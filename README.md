# FlashCards Project

## Abstract

- The FlashCards Project was designed to test my fellow cohort mates and I on our abilities to contribute code to a partially constructed application, follow a spec/prompts to make a working application, implement some ES6 classes, and practice our TDD abilities with Mocha/Chai. This project was extremely challenging for me, and although I didn’t reach my goals, I was able to learn a lot from this project, and plan on continuing to work on it in the future.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Mocha/Chai

## Context and Features

- The FlashCards project is supposed to be a program that simulates a set of flashcards through the command line. The user should be able to see questions, guess answers, and finally see their final score at the end of the round. Unfortunately, I was not able to reach the functionality goals of this project. I was able to design and build out nearly all of the classes and testing suites for this project, which was a welcome learning experience for me. Although I was unsuccessful in the functional goals of this project, I do plan on continuing to work on finishing this project in the future. 

## Illustrations

## Lessons Learned

- Although I was unsuccessful in finishing the functionality of this project, I did learn a lot about Test Driven Development (TDD) with Mocha/Chai. I also learned how to use many different features and syntax of the expect Chai Assertion Library. I also learned how to utilize some features of ES6 including arrow functions, and scoping variable declarations. Lastly, I learned how to use class to class interaction on a much greater level that I have previously done.    

## Future Features

Some future features I’d like to add to this application are:

- Calculating the percentage of correct answers.
- Ending a round of the game. 
- Having the game be fully functional and playable.  
- A gif of my functioning application. 


## Application Set-Up

1. Fork repository on GitHub.

2. `Git clone` the repository to your local machine.

3. `Cd` into the directory.

4. Run `open index.html` in your terminal.
